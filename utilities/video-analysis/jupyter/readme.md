## List of samples

| Name       | Extension | Accelerator| Description | Tested On &nbsp;|
|:---:        |:---:       |:---:        |:---       |:---       |
| [Yolo V3](yolov3-icpu-onnx/readme.md)             | HTTP      | iCPU | LVA module using Yolo V3, a neural network for real-time object detection, that complies with the Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX). Follow this sample if your solution requires an Intel CPU accelerated IoT Edge device with connection through HTTP. |  Python 3.6:<ul><li>[ ] MacOS</li><li>[ ] Ubuntu 18.04</li></ul> |
| [Tiny Yolo V3](tinyyolov3-icpu-onnx/readme.md)    | HTTP      | iCPU | LVA module using Tiny Yolo V3, a lightweight variant of the Yolo V3 neural network model, that complies with the Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX). Follow this sample if your solution requires an Intel CPU accelerated IoT Edge device with connection through HTTP. |  Python 3.6:<ul><li>[ ] MacOS</li><li>[ ] Ubuntu 18.04</li></ul> |
| [Tiny Yolo V3](http://aka.ms/)                    | gRPC      | iCPU | LVA module using Tiny Yolo V3, a lightweight variant of the Yolo V3 neural network model, that complies with the Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX). Follow this sample if your solution requires an Intel CPU accelerated IoT Edge device with connection through gRPC. gRPC is a remote procedure call that efficiently connects services in and across data centers with pluggable support for load balancing, tracing, health checking and authentication. | Python 3.6:<ul><li>[ ] MacOS</li><li>[ ] Ubuntu 18.04</li></ul> |
| [Yolo V3](yolov3-ngpu-onnx/readme.md)             | HTTP      | nGPU |  LVA module using Yolo V3, a neural network for real-time object detection, that complies with the Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX). Follow this sample if your solution requires an NVidia GPU accelerated IoT Edge device with connection through HTTP. |  Python 3.6:<ul><li>[ ] MacOS</li><li>[ ] Ubuntu 18.04</li></ul> |
